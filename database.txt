#What do you understand By Database ?
=>A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically
    store aggregations of data records or files that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials
    and product information.
     
#What do you mean Normalisation?
=>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. It includes creating tables and establishing relationships 
    between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by
    eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency

# What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
=>DBMS stands for Database Management System, which is a software that allows users to create,manipulate and manage 
    data in a database.,
    RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System which is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables and uses
    SQL as a query language.
     
#What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems?
=>Codd's rule in DBMS also known as Codd's 12 rules/commandments is a set of thirteen rules (numbered 0 to 12)
    that define a database to be a correct Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). If a database follows
    Codd's 12 rules, it is called a True relational database management system.

#What do you understand By Data Redundancy? 
=>Data redundancy means that the same pieces of data are kept in two or more places within a database or data storage system.

#What is DDL Interpreter?
=>DDL Interpreter is a component of a DBMS that translates the data definition language (DDL) statements into a set of tables,
    views, indexes, and other database objects.

#What is DML Compiler in SQL?
=>DML Compiler DML expands to Data Manipulation Language in DBMS. DML Compiler again as the name suggests compiles
    (or translates) the DML statements such as select, update and delete statements into low-level instructions which is nothing but 
    the machine-readable object code to make it executable.

#What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints
=>SQL Key Constraints are rules that enforce the uniqueness and referential integrity of the data in a database
     Example: CREATE TABLE STUDENT ( ID int , Name varchar(255) , Age int, CHECK (Age>=18) ); 

#What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?
=>Savepoint is a command in SQL that is used with the rollback command.
    SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME;
     
#What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
=>Trigger is a database object that is associated with a table and automatically executes a set of SQL statements when a specific 
     event occurs on that table.
     1) CREATE TRIGGER schema. trigger_name.
     2) ON table_name.
     3) AFTER {INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE}
    4)  [NOT FOR REPLICATION]
    5) AS.
    6) {SQL_Statements}
